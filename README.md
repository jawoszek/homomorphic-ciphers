# homomorphic-ciphers

This project is an simple example of creating _somewhat homomorphic_ solution, that allows encryption, decryption, and homomorphic addition conducted on integers.

## Running the project

Python 3.x and `git` are prerequisites. To run project using `bash`:
```
git clone https://github.com/jawoszek/homomorphic-ciphers.git
cd homomorphic-ciphers/
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
python3 tests/test_somewhat_homomorphic.py
```

Execution of the test suite above should take around 3-5 minutes, depending on CPU.
